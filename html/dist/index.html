Things were different back then. The household technology consisted of a landline phone, a TV, and an electronic calculator. This changed drastically with the arrival of the computer, and like many other kids, him and his brother were intuitively drawn to it. They learned the buttons on the keyboard by playing digger. They learned their first english words playing Monkey Island 1. Then along came the internet, and that tiny computer in their living rooms became a portal to the rest of the world.</p><p>Rune has started his own design agency in Denmark, developed interactive features for the New York Times, and taught graduate classes at the <a href="http://tisch.nyu.edu/itp" target="_blank">Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University</a>. He now spends most of his time working for O’Reilly Media, while running a small art studio.</p></div></div><div class="panelistContainer"><div class="headshot pull-left"><img src="images/caitlin.jpg"></div><div class="bio"><h3 class="oneLine"><a href="http://www.caitlinmorris.net/" target="_blank">Caitlin Morris</a></h3><h4>artist + creative technologist at <a href="http://www.hypersonic.cc/" target="_blank">Hypersonic</a></h4><p>Artist and technologist working with digital and fabricated media.</p><p>Caitlin explores the interaction in physical space, with a recurring emphasis on sound and perception, and toys with the boundary between digital and physical representations of space.

His work focuses on the synthesis of form as the product of parametric behaviors. He is known for hard-edged geometrical forms and vivid colors, with outputs ranging from pure software works to public projections and physical objects produced with digital fabrication technology.</p><p>Watz has exhibited at venues like the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum (London), Todaysart (The Hague), ITAU Cultural (Sao Paulo), Museumsquartier (Vienna), and Galleri ROM (Oslo). In a curating capacity, he founded Generator.x in 2005 as a platform for a series of events related to generative art and computational design. In 2010 he co-curated the exhibition "<a href="https://www.field.io/exhibition/node10-frankfurter-kunstverein/" target="_blank">abstrakt Abstrakt: The Systemized World</a>"" with <a href="http://enohenze.de/" target="_blank">Eno Henze</a> at the Frankfurter Kunstverein.</p><p>In Fall 2013 Watz was an adjunct and resident researcher at <a href="http://tisch.nyu.edu/itp" target="_blank">NYU ITP</a>, focusing on parametric form and digital fabrication.
